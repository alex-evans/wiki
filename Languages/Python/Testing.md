Prefer pytest over unittest. 

## [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
- Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names);
- Auto-discovery of test modules and functions;
- Modular fixtures for managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources;
- Can run unittest (or trial), nose test suites out of the box;
- Python 3.5+ and PyPy3;
- Rich plugin architecture, with over 315+ external plugins and thriving community;
