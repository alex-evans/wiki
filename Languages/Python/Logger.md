Prefer [Loguru](https://pypi.org/project/loguru/). It's what Hichhiker to Python recommends and early use shows me that it's easier than using the built into Python logging.

## [Loguru](https://pypi.org/project/loguru/):
- Ready to use out of the box without boilerplate
- No Handler, no Formatter, no Filter: one function to rule them all
- Easier file logging with rotation / retention / compression
- Modern string formatting using braces style
- Exceptions catching within threads or main
- Pretty logging with colors
- Asynchronous, Thread-safe, Multiprocess-safe
- Fully descriptive exceptions
- Structured logging as needed
- Lazy evaluation of expensive functions
- Customizable levels
- Better datetime handling
- Suitable for scripts and libraries
- Entirely compatible with standard logging
- Personalizable defaults through environment variables
- Convenient parser
- Exhaustive notifier
- 10x faster than built-in logging
