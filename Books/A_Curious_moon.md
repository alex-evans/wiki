## Why am I reading this book?
Deep dive into Postgres so that I can learn it for work. We are going to start storing data for testing into a Postgres db and I wanted to spend a week diving deep into it.

## Great quotes
- "Our goal is correct, complete, accurate data." - pg54
- "When you have a data-first mindset, all of this becomes clear. Your job becomes easier, and you guarentee your position for many years. You'll become valuable to the team, to your managers and, most of all, to me. In short: you'll be a better developer." - pg322
- "Good data is good observation, as free of bias as possible, even down the very platform, it's served from. Your data is only as good as your ability to interrogate and understand it." - pg323
- "This would be incorrect and against everything we're trying to do here which is to let the data tell the story, not you,... If you find yourself filling in the gaps, the story becomes yours, and the data becomes fictional." -pg371
- "Dee’s new law: if propelling ‘good’ design makes you write needless code, take up unnecessary space or make the system needlessly work harder, something’s wrong."

## Actionable items
- See if there is a way to print out and share just the "Why Postgres" chapter. 
- Share with team if able to print out the "Why Postgres" chapter.

## Summary
Really nice dive into what it's like to use Postgres in the real world. Not just a tutorial but nice to have a story to go with it. It provides a lot of data and guides you how someone would approach it.

## Thoughts
I enjoyed probably 80% of this book. Towards the end when it got less into the data and the story was trying to come to a conclusion I struggled liking the main character in the book. The data though was really cool and her story was great, I liked how it was written as a journal but there were things at the end you find out that weren't in the journal that were happening.

This was a fun way to learn Postgres. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to dive into it.
