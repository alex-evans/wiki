## Why am I reading this book?
Deep dive into Postgres so that I can learn it for work. We are going to start storing data for testing into a Postgres db and I wanted to spend a week diving deep into it.

## Great quotes
- "Our goal is correct, complete, accurate data." - pg54
- "When you have a data-first mindset, all of this becomes clear. Your job becomes easier, and you guarentee your position for many years. You'll become valuable to the team, to your managers and, most of all, to me. In short: you'll be a better developer." - pg322
- "Good data is good observation, as free of bias as possible, even down the very platform, it's served from. Your data is only as good as your ability to interrogate and understand it." - pg323
- "This would be incorrect and against everything we're trying to do here which is to let the data tell the story, not you,... If you find yourself filling in the gaps, the story becomes yours, and the data becomes fictional." -pg371

## Actionable items
- See if there is a way to print out and share just the "Why Postgres" chapter. 
- Share with team if able to print out the "Why Postgres" chapter.
