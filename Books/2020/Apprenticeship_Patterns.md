## Patterns
- A Different Road

    To take the software craftman path you have to accept that it is not the normal road. People are going to question why you turn down a promotion or stay with coding. It needs to be an active decision.

- Be the Worst

    You improve the best when you're working with people that are better than you. Seek out positions where you can learn and grow with strong teams.

- Breakable Toys

    In order to learn and get better at things you need to be able to fail. At work it is tough to be able to get those failure experiences too often and so you need to be able to try things on your own that are fun that let you fail. Don't be afraid to just throw away any of those things you build with that.

- Concrete Skills

- Confront Your Ignorance

- Craft over Art

    For work you know that it is more important to get a solution out that works in quick time instead of focusing on the art of a system. A craftsman builds things that people use.

- Create Feedback Loops

    You need to reach out to others or find ways to discover what you're doing well and more importantly what you are not doing well at / don't know about.

- Dig Deeper

- Draw Your Own Map

    Your employer is not going to build you a career map that fits you. You need to take control of that and push / learn at your own direction.

- Expand Your Bandwidth

- Expose Your Ignorance

- Familiar Tools

- Find Mentors

- Kindred Spirits

- Learn How You Fail

- Nurture Your Passion

- Practice, Practice, Practice

- Read Constantly

    Make sure you are still diving deep into actual books and not just focusing on blog posts or simple on the surface topics

- Reading List

- Record What You Learn

- Reflect as You Work

- Retreat into Competence

- Rubbing Elbows

- Share What You Learn

- Stay in the Trenches

    You will be offered promotions and opportunities that will take you out of software coding. Be aware of those and that it will be a short term gain but will pull you away from a software craftsman's journey.

- Study the Classics

- Sustainable Motiviations

- Sweep the Floor

- The Deep End

- The Long Road

- The White Belt

    In order to learn new topics you at times need to clear out what you know and start fresh on a topic.

- Unleash Your Enthusiasm

- Use the Source

- Use Your Title

- Your First Language

## Quotes From the Book
- "It is certainly important and inevitable for our industry to have experts, but that is not the goal of the apprentice."

- "To transition to journeyman and ultimately master craftsman, you are going to need to be skilled at creating feedback loops, and also to be intimately familiar with your weaknesses."

- "You should not also underestimate the power of writing itself....You can lose your larger sense of purpose. But writing lets you step back and think through a problem. Even the angriest rant forces the writer to achieve a degree of thoughtfulness." — Atul Gawande, Better

- "I can not overstate how much a generous spirit contributes to good luck. Look at the luckiest people around you, the ones you envy, the ones who seem to have destiny falling habitually into their laps. What are they doing that singles them out? It isn’t dumb luck if it happens repeatedly. If they’re anything like the fortunate people I know, they’re prepared, they’re always working at their craft, they’re alert, they involve their friends in their work, and they tend to make others feel lucky to be around them." — Twyla Tharp, The Creative Habit

- **Good idea** "In the programming language of your choice, use a simple text editor (later on you will see why it’s important that you don’t use an IDE for this exercise) to write an implementation of binary search in one sitting. Do not compile or run it yet. Now, write all the tests that you think you will need to verify that you have a correct implementation. Keep note of the bugs and problems you discover at this stage. Now, still without compiling or running the tests, go back and fix all the problems that you have discovered so far. Iterate until you’re satisfied that the code and the tests are both perfect. Finally, try to compile and run the tests."

- "He’d no longer be a grade-motivated person. He’d be a knowledge-motivated person. He would need no external pushing to learn. His push would come from the inside.... Motivation of this sort, once it catches hold, is a ferocious force." — Robert Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

- **Good idea** "Find and read RFC 2616, which describes HTTP1.1, and RFC 707, which describes the state of the art in Remote Procedure Call technology as of January 1976. Armed with your deeper knowledge of HTTP"
