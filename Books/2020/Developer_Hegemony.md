**Stopped halfway**

## Recap
Didn't finish this one. Got about halfway through. The book was entertaining and interesting but after awhile lost interest. A lot of great things to think about and keep myself aware of though. The enterprise world is filled with folks that are gaming the system to get and stay at the top. There are people who work to just get the paycheck and that's fine too. Good things to keep in mind and really the world presented at the beginning with the team of software engineers just working and solving problems and that's the business and how project management has been moved to just really an administrative task is a world I would love to live in. Something to strive for.
