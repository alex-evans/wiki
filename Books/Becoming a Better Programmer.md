## Notes
- *To write good code, you have to care about it. To become a better programmer you must invest time and effort.* (pg14)

    Need passion to improve

- *In any coding situation, you refuse to hack something that only seems to work. You strive to craft elegant code that is clearly correct (and has good tests to show that it is correct).* (pg14)

    Don't always look for the quick shallow changes, before making fixes understand the change needed unless on serious time crunch

- *There is nothing wrong with an emotional response to code. Being proud of your great work, or disgusted at bad code, is healthy.* (pg15)

- *Stop fighting over code layout. Adopt a healthy attitude to your code presentation* (pg18)

    This is a great point. Need to focus on what truly matters and not just the look over the code.
