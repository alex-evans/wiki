## Notes
- **07/15/20 Night's Reflection:** Start of the book and I like the feel of the book but it's hard not to look over the fact that it will be a beast of a book to get through. So we will see. At least it appears to be well written. I liked the tying of writing programs as writing sorcery. It's a good mental image while coding, makes it fun and I think that's the opening point that this should be fun but we should keep getting stronger with what we make and become. The using of Lisp hit me as surprising but I have to remind myself this is an older book and also that it's good to pickup new languages and see what they are like. My tired brain may not be able to absorb much these days but at least I'll get a feel of this stuff.

    *For all its power, the computer is a harsh taskmaster.*

    *hardware always operates at a level more primitive than that at which we care to program*

    *Even though some programs resist precise specifications, it is the responsibility of the programmer to estimate, and always to attempt to improve, their performance*

        Not sure if I agree with this one. I know we want to focus on performance and that was probably more of a deal back when this is written but I believe readability is the focus to always attempt to improve on programs without hurting performance or quality.

    *We toast the Lisp programmer who pens his thoughts within nests of parentheses.*

    *Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as a soap bubble? - Alan J. Perlis*

    *Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that "computer science" is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.*

    **Chapter 1**
    *Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring.*
