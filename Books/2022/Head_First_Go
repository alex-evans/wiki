Quick Description: Introduction to the GoLang. Takes you through a deep dive of how to get going on GoLang 

Rating: A


## Why am I reading this book?
I want to at least learn a language a year. GoLang is a language that I wanted to dive deep into for awhile. It has a lot of similarities to Python and it would be good to have another language to compare and contrast to against Python.


## Actionable items
- Build portfolio and other apps with Go to continue to strengthen my understanding of it.

## Summary
This was a great book. I enjoyed how it enforced the fundamentals of Go in a way that was dry. It kept me coding but also not just copying code. I feel I now have a high level understanding of how to code with Go and would be able to build something with it. I'm going to try to continue my understanding by actually building things with it.
