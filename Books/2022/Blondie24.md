Quick Description: Describes the process of creating an AI model that can play checkers as an expert while not providing it any information on how to play checkers other than what a novice checkers player would know. The focus was no on rules based AI but more on evolutionary AI creation.

## Why am I reading this book?
Coworker gave me this book as it fits nicely into what we do with Machine Learning.

## Summary
I enjoyed this book as it provides a solid foundation of understanding the different approaches to creating AI models and how previous approaches of rules based may provide a solution to one specfic problem but really doesn't provide a way for a machine to "learn" how to solve unknown problems. It also shows how far away (at least when the checkers AI was built) we are from a true HAL AI machine that can "think" and interact with us humans as if they were human.
