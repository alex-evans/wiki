## Summary
Golf is a hobby of mine and this book does deep dive into Phil Mickelson's life. He is one of the more interesting people out there and can't really decide if I'm a fan or if he is a bad person. Lots of amazing stories and probably more of a sad story as it appears Phil just can't get out of his own way. His story isn't finished though as I'm guessing we will continue to get stories about Phil for the next 20+ years.
