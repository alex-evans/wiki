Quick Description: Sid Meier's reflection and memoir on his life in the gaming industry 
Rating: 9/10

## Why am I reading this book?
Sid Meier created the game I spent the most time on as a child (Civilization II). I played every Civilization game after that and also spent way too much time with Railroad Tycoon 2. It's great getting an idea of how he created those games and also to get a feel of what it was like back then as a developer.

## Actionable items
- Never jump into the game dev world. It sounds like fun but the hours and work will bleed you dry. You have to have a serious passion for the games and tech and I would worry about spending years of my life on a game that only a few people would play for maybe a month and would make no money on.

## Summary / Thoughts
This was a great book. I loved hearing how really his games were stepping stones on each other. Even some games were just to get a feel on the technology. Really something that stuck with me is his approach to making games, he had to try out something and tweak it over and over again and make it better and better if he could. In order to get anyone to understand and buy into what he wanted to build or was thinking he had to initially do everything even though he knew it would eventually be pulled out of the game. He also felt the need to understand each part of the game.

I was also surprised to read that besides the first Civilization he wasn't all that involved, at least for the next few. Same with Railroad Tycoon. That means that since I played the 2nd of these series I played really someone else's take on Sid's game. Obviously, he was still a heavy contributor to the main idea and the rules around the game.

He also commented on a bizzare story where there was a glitch in the game that spread on the internet about Gandi becoming a nuke war monger after discovery deplomacy in Civilization. It was crazy to hear that it actually never happen but that the internet just basically ran with the story. Shows how an incorrect story can blow up into the majority of people believing it as a fact. Dig for facts!

I feel good knowing Sid's back story now and that Sid isn't just a name tied to video games. I have a personal connection with Civ and Railroad Tycoon as they were games my dad got for me and was interested in. I remember talking with him about the games when my dad rarely showed any interest in video games. I was always proud to show him the initial Civ game I played and how the Civilization grew (the Americans). I can even remember in my head how that map / civilization looked (or at least I think I do).
