    **Year Summary**
    Spent the start of the year really focused on learning as much as I could about Docker and Python. This helped me a bit get over a lot of imposter syndrom I was dealing with in my new role. As the year progressed I switch more into what I see as improvements as a whole in software engineering and started to dive into some of the foundations of a computer science education books. I also sprinkled in some fun books to enjoy throughout the year. With being in lockdown for most of the year due to Covid the number of audio books shrunk greatly as I was no longer commuting to work and back every day.

    **Year Summary**
    Changed jobs halfway through the year and that's where the Docker book came needed and Python. Unicorn Project was a bit of a let down but I don't think it had anything to do with it being any different from the Phoenix Project but more just where I am in my career. Phoenix Project I was all about management at a big company that was trying to "go Agile". Now being a developer at a small company I feel different and have become anti-scrum (agile good, but Scrum not great). The Unicorn Project just felt force fed and unrealistic. I like the writing style and there were times where it motivated me as a developer but overall just didn't feel as big of an effect as Phoenix Project.
