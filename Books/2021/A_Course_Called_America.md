## Why am I reading this book?
Fun reading on the different golf courses and experiences.

## Interesting thoughts
I love how he finishes the book playing a round of golf with his dad. I have memories of my dad and a lot of them are on the golf course. Those were always where I saw him appear to have the most fun and probably the most like himself as around friends and not as my father. Tom has a great point at the end of the book that he finally realized to just let life lead him a bit and not try to plan everything out. Just follow it a bit. This his me as great advice, live in the moment a bit and don't be dumb but also just enjoy the travel of life every once in a while. Tom inspired me to play more golf and play in more places.

## Great quotes


## Actionable items
Enjoy life and get on the golf course as much as possible, but also enjoy the experiences of being with other people on those golf courses. Don't get frustrated being put with others in a foursome, instead of being embarrased about being with a stranger get to know them and it'll probably be the only time you interact with them but you will remember the experience from then on. Also don't be an ass to folks out there, be a good person. It seems like most people are good people and just don't spend time with the people that are asses.
