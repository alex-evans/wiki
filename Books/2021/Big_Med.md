## Why am I reading this book?
My career is in healthcare IT. I have religiously read HISTalk for 10+ years now and he recommended this book as a great way to understand why we are in the spot where we are now with Healthcare. If I remember right he mentions the solutions the authors come to might not be possible but the background they give does help a ton. I want to learn more about how we are in this mess and possibly where I can help.

## Chapters review and notes
### Preface
Main statement is that most policy and debate currently is focused on the wrong things. They focus on drug companies and insurers and Medicare. The focus needs to be on the Big Providers and the dangers and failures they bring to the game.

### Introduction
No surprise but introduction chapter on what the book contains. Emphasized the problem, providers have gotten too big and our policy focus is on the wrong spot. These non-profit health systems have no reason not to enforce their power. A good point is the leaders of these health systems are probably hoping to provide health care at a lower cost but that's not their focus / they believe they can do that by gaining power. In the book it'll go through the history, how things got us to where they are, and then what is failing now, and finally into what we could do.

### 1: The Evolution of the Modern Hospital
History of healthcare in the United States consists of Medical centers growing and hanging on to power of the health care delivery. Once they were established as the kings of the area they focused on how to keep it instead of improve it. Granted it was an interest of theirs to improve how they could but they put a lot of effort into making sure no threats to their pipeline of $$ was cut off. Lots of different attempts were made to either have new players enter the rhelm or government intervention to push for healthy more efficent populations but these all failed as they didn't solve the entire problem and the end result has been bigger and bigger health systems.
