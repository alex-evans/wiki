## Why am I reading this book?
For fun. Same author as The Martian and Artemis which I highly enjoyed. Hearing from my friend Ryan it sounds like this is even nerdier than The Martian and a great read. Looking forward to it.

## Summary
Had a great time reading this book. Really like Andy Weir's books. Deep down it's a science fiction nerd deep dive into physics but it's a lot of fun. Entertaining. The main character I struggled a bit with at the end when I discovered more about him and who he was but it's also a weird situation to find yourself in when you discover more and more about you. Makes you really ponder also the possiblity of life outside of our planet and how when coding I'm always sure I'm making a mistake somewhere but in space with physics and huge huge huge numbers one small mistake or thing you don't realize will kill you.
