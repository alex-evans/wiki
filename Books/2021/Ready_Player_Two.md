## Why am I reading this book?
I highly enjored the first one. Heard this one isn't as great but still a fun one to read. 

## Interesting thoughts


## Great quotes


## Actionable items


## Summary
Stopped reading for now, got about 30 pages in and started to get bored with it. I didn't like how the main character was acting like an idiot and wasn't being all that likeable. The tech was some what interesting but not as much fun as discoverying the world and the pursuit after. I'm guessing I would get deeper into it down the line. I'll try it again some day but for now just going to stop.
