## Why am I reading this book?
Farther my understanding on how to build something that can scale. It's truly something I haven't had a ton of experience with and I want to learn more. Reviews were solid and it was included as a book to tackle if you want to get a solid computer science understanding.

## Chapters review and notes

### Part I. Foundations of Data Systems

#### 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
This chapter focused on setting the foundation for the three main things focused on when building a system, reliability, scalability, and maintainability. Reliability - faults and failures are not the same thing. Faults are an error to one specific piece but a failure is the entire system stops working. You can build reliability by handling faults in a way that you avoid failures. Scalability - having a strategy to tackle performance when load increases. Maintainability - often the thing I am thinking about most but not the only thing to focus on, making sure code and architecture is built in a way where it can be updated and understood long term.

#### 2. Data Models and Query Languages

#### 3. Storage and Retrieval

#### 4. Encoding and Evolution

### Part II. Distributed Data

#### 5. Replication

#### 6. Partitioning

#### 7. Transactions

#### 8. The Trouble with Distributed Systems

#### 9. Consistence and Consensus

### Part III. Derived Data

#### 10. Batch Processing

#### 11. Stream Processing

#### 12. The Future of Data Systems

## Interesting thoughts


## Great quotes
- "...we can understand reliability as meaning, roughly, 'continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong.'" pg6
