## Why am I reading this book?
Part of a list of papers I got that said every software engineer should read these papers twice. I'll probably only read them once but good to look over. This paper will help me think through how distributed systems is a problem that can't be solved in the abstract of thinking as still all locally running routines. Need to keep in mind this paper was written in the 1990s but still a lot of lessons to pull from it.
