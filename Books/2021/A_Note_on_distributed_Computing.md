## Why am I reading this book?
Part of a list of papers I got that said every software engineer should read these papers twice. I'll probably only read them once but good to look over. This paper will help me think through how distributed systems is a problem that can't be solved in the abstract of thinking as still all locally running routines. Need to keep in mind this paper was written in the 1990s but still a lot of lessons to pull from it.

## Chapters review and notes
### Abstract

### 1. Introduction
Just a level setting on the difference between local and distributed computing. Basically local is running everything on the same address space while distributed is you don't know if the machine is the same or some other address space. The article argues that architectures being built with the mindset of local only is destine to fail.

### 2. The Vision of Unified Objects

### 3. Deja Vu All Over Again

### 4. Local and Distributed Computing

### 5. The Myth of "Quality of Service"

### 6. Lessons from NFS

### 7. Taking the Difference Seriously

### 8. A Middle Ground

## Interesting thoughts


## Great quotes


## Actionable items


## Summary
Lost interest in this article. Seems to be a bit too deep into the weeds and written too uninteresting to catch my attention currently. Not going to dive through each point just to say I read it. Probably some good comments in there but overall at this point in time it wasn't for me.
