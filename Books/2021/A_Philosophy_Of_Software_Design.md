## Why am I reading this book?
As I get deeper into a software senior engineer role I need to improve upon my understanding of how to create code that can be used long term. I am always looking for ways to improve on my own code (there are tons I still need to learn) and this book has been pointed to as a great book for doing that. I want to create code where anyone could pick it up (including myself months down the line) and understand quickly what it is doing and also be able to make changes and improve it without fear of destroying the product / service.

## Chapters review and notes
### Chapter 1 - Introduction
Just an intro into the book and how he went about coming up with the content. It is interesting that he kind of used his class to experiment on and find out what design works. Classic teacher who never stops learning. I think one major thing to pull is that you learn a ton from reading other people's code. That is something I am missing currently as I am mainly dealing with my code.
