## Why am I reading this book?
I need to have a better understanding of what it means to be black in America. It has become embarrasingly obvious that I grew up in a bubble thinking racism was only a subject for the history books in this country. Recent events in the past few years has made it painfully obvious that this is far from the truth. I need to understand more of what it means to be black in this country and the pain that has and still happens in this world. Malcolm X's story will help give some meaning / understanding around this.
