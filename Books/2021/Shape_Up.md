Quick Description: A look at how Basecamp builds software.

Rating: 9/10


## Why am I reading this book?
This looks to be a nice approach outside of Scrum to build software. I like the idea of sort of maturing out of scrum and finding a better solution. Interested to hear the details on how Basecamp does it and how it differs from Scrum.

## Chapters review and notes
### Chapter 1: Introduction
Just an introduction into the book. Gives a history of the process / who they are. I've known of the other two founders of Basecamp but not Ryan Singer who is the author of this book. This book isn't going to go deep into his history but nice to get another view from a successful company that somehow gets software out the door in a different manner than most. I see it as a more realistic development approach. The intro introduced Shaping, Betting and Building as the process and 6 weeks investments of time. I'm excited by what I hear and can't stop thinking of how it could possibly be brought into my current company.

**Part 1: Shaping**
### Chapter 2: Principles of Shaping
This was interesting. Often times I think of there not being enough detail for something to be estimated, we will just see how it comes together and keep shaping our estimate from it but I didn't think about how too much detail, when you know too much of what you want is a problem too. It takes more time to fit a product into an exact spec then to let the product naturally find the scope. You want to be able to fix time and shave scope. Not fix scope and let time float. So keeping the shape of what you're going to tackle is important. Get a rough answer but make sure it's an answer too. You want to avoid having the team go down too many rabbit holes (hopefully they don't go down any). I like to live in a world of trust but some people might also question how do you keep the "Shapers" accountable if they can just keep a ton of stuff in progress. I believe there will always be work and it will be obvious if a shaper isn't pulling their weight but it's also an art and there is a reason why the more experienced seasoned vets are the shapers. I choose to live in a world of trust.

### Chapter 3: Set Boundaries
Boundaries are very very very important. I have fallen into the classic trap that most developers fall into by making my first instinct being "we need to redo this". Rebuilding a system is very appealing but also 99% of the time not needed. Instead you need to find what is the problem, the real problem on why a redo might make sense. Once you set the problem start shaving it down or at least understanding it enough where you can truly get your hands around it. While doing this you need to get a feel of how much you want this change and if you're willing to put the work into it or if there is a smaller change that fits more with your "appetite". A lot of this is a way to say, you need to do the work up front before you start changing code. Understand the change before you code it. As I've read before, design the thing twice before you code.

### Chapter 4: Find the Elements
This chapter gave some great ideas / approaches on how to shape a raw idea. It's important that you start to have those conversations on how do we add this feature but you don't want to get tied to a specific deep down detail or approach that is way too deep into the weeds. The idea here is to keep things moving, have high level discussions and be able to quickly switch things in and out / ideas. The note at the end of the chapter is very important. This is still in the shaping section and nothing has been committed. Just because you're shapping an idea it doesn't have to be worked on and there is no implied this is the next thing up, you're just trying to get a raw idea into a possible solution that can be betted on.

### Chapter 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes
I see this step as the let's take a step back and make sure we aren't missing anything (or more to the point, we don't have any major holes in our idea that couldn't be answered by the team in a time crunch). This is also a stage where you can bring in a technical person to just whiteboard the idea. Main thing again is to keep in mind this is still just a raw idea, nothing has been commited to and avoid going to deep into details with people. Keep everything high level. One good thing to do is write out what this idea is not.

### Chapter 6: Write the Pitch
The final step in the shaping step is pulling everything together and creating a pitch. This can be an important step and also one I feel like takes time to understand how much time and detail to put into it. You would want to avoid having this become the perfect polished up product pitch as it's still in the idea phase and realistically you don't want people spending all their time working on a pitch. A template of sorts would be nice and the one this chapter gives on what is provided in a pitch would be a great way to start. It also would be cool to look into if we could use iPads or some method to get digital drawing easily into a document.

**Part 2: Betting**
### Chapter 7: Bets, Not Backlogs
Quick to the point chapter. Backlogs are not helpful to go over every iteration. They become a big list of nothing where you have to try to remember pieces about the items every time and context / motivation is lost on the item. On top of that time is wasted reviewing and keeping backlogs up to date on stuff that will never get done. It's comforting to have a backlog but it needs to be let go. It's not truly helping. Instead every 6 weeks have a conversation about ideas people are passionate about at the moment. If it is an old idea they will bring it back and improve upon it / push for it. I like this.

### Chapter 8: The Betting Table
A lot packed into this chapter and probably one to reread after done with the book. It gets into the details of how this all works. The Betting Table is the key component. You bring a small group of true organization decision makers (C level and senior level but small small group). You go through the pitches that everyone is already aware of and you decide if you want to bet on them and which ones. This chapter also talks about the size of teams (small! one or two devs and a designer with an integration tester jumping around). It also hits on the thing I'm sure everyone thinks about, what about bugs! The point of the book is that bugs aren't for some reason more important than the projects. You'll never get anything new done if you have to fix the whole world first. The key here is there are two main agreements / rules: 

1. You give teams uninterupted 6 weeks to work on their stuff. 
2. Anything not done after 6 weeks is dropped at least one cycle to be reevaluated and pitched.

I think both are powerful and extremly tough to do but if you do not commit to these rules the entire process breaks. They are the two important agreements that as a dev team / company need to fully buy in on.
### Chapter 9: Place Your Bets
This was interesting. Depending on the status / maturity of a project (new or existing product) the bets can expect different endings. I think this makes sense and probably brings some real world element to all of this. You can't just assume each bet has the same outcome regardless if it's a new or old product. Old established products get the sort of bet you'd expect with the outcome of a cycle being the finished solution that was bet on but a new product goes through separate stages (R&D, Production, Cleanup). R&D you're learning, Production you're growing, and Cleanup well you're cleaning up the product. It was interesting also that cleanup is often more than just one cycle and is more of a what do we take out of the product stage. 

After that it becomes what do we bet on and who is going to do it. It's interesting that Basecamp takes the approach of assigning projects to people and that people are not tied to the same team every cycle. 

**Part3: Building**
### Chapter 10: Hand Over Responsibility
The team starts to dive in. They are given the pitch or a version of the pitch that gives the details on what is the goal of the project. They are not given a list of tasks. Tasks are on the team to determine and use. There's a key piece of the project where everyone is diving into it but things are silent. It's important for a manager to trust the team and not start to ask how it's going to early. Let the team learn / get the lay of the land. Also as the team builds tasks they tend to start with imaginary tasks they think they will need to do and then it grows a ton more as they get their hands dirty into a real tasks. The only way to understand the tasks needed is to get your hands dirty and do the work.
### Chapter 11: Get One Piece Done
Some just general key pieces to keep in mind when going through a 6 week cycle. You don't have a ton of time. Focus on a meaningful piece of the project that the team can get done in just a few days. This is a verticle slice of the project (not just a mock up of the front end or a stubbed out piece of the backend). I believe there's a lot of strength to this as it gives something for the team to push off of. We have this done, where do we go next. A good point towards the end the chapter made was make sure you also pick something where the team will learn the most possible. Don't just take on an easy piece that the team already knows how to do, tackle the hard piece first and see what you can learn.

### Chapter 12: Map the Scopes
Starting into coding a solution you might have a general idea of how it divides up but it's very high level and unproven. As you get deeper into the code you start to really move things around and find the natural scope of what needs to be done. This helps explain progress on a solution and also keeps the team focused and motivated. Something the chapter points out that is a great thing to keep in mind, be weary of using just a grab bag / general description for a bunch of tasks (bugs, front end, back end). They don't truly tell you much about what is in the tasks that need to be done. I like the tip at the end of the chapter saying if you do have a few tasks that don't quite fit into a bucket or are "nice to haves" put a ~ in front of their description. Let's you know if there is time do this.

### Chapter 13: Show Progress
This was an interesting solution to the how do we ask for status without interupting the team or making them do a lot of extra work. The hill concept is an interesting one and would take time to get it right but would be a cool thing to try out. Should look into trying it.

### Chapter 14: Decide When to Stop
This is a difficult problem and the reason I feel like all teams I've been on struggle with scrum, the end dates are not true end dates. We always would run over or just say ok, this story will just bleed into the next sprint. So how do you know when to stop. I like the approach with the hill to climb and knowing where you are with a project and also the circuit breaker that everyone has to buy in on that if a project doesn't meet it's deadline it short circuits and doesn't go into the next cycle. Of course you have to be realistic with this stuff and on the rare occasion you let it flow into a new cycle or have ways to finish things in the cool down period but it is a good point that this should only be for projects that are on their way down the hill and shouldn't be a habit. If a project still has unknowns then it must go through the betting process again.

I also liked the point on QA and dream of being in that position where the team can produce solid tested code for the main functionality and the QA person just tests the edge cases and looks for gotchas to solidify the product farther. I don't think I've ever seen that ability in practice but it's a good goal to hit for.

### Chapter 15: Move On
Good point here. Don't overreact to initial feedback. Make sure to take that feedback and shape it into a pitch for the next betting table if needed but don't commit to anything right away. Take a cool down period and really focus in on what you're hearing and make a bet on where you want to go with the proper pitch.

**Conclusion**
Just a recap of everything that was in the book.

## Interesting thoughts


## Great quotes
- "You can't ship anything new if you have to fix the whole world first." - Chapter 8
- "The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start doing real work." - Chapter 10
- "We should question any new work that comes up before we accept it as necessary." - Chatper 14


## Actionable items
- Present this to Benj and Todd and see if we can try a version of it

## Summary
This ultimately may have been an advertisement for using Basecamp but I really liked their approach. Gave a great argument for doing something other than scrum that I hadn't heard out there in the wild being done. This is very intriguing. I like the shape up to betting table to how to get things done. Some great stuff in there. Looking forward to trying it.
