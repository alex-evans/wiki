**Done**

## Recap
Some good stuff in the book. I enjoyed the realistic talk from someone who has gone through the paces. A lot of stuff I haven't ever thought of and helps saves the traps that developers who want to start their own business probably ran into. I read only about half the book and if I get focused again on starting my own thing I should probably dive back into it and finish it off. A lot of great stuff in there to just skim through though if I do want to get my brain back going on this stuff.
