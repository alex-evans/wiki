* [The Different CTO Roles](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/07/the_different_cto_roles.html) - Werner Vogels (Amazon CTO)

    A good summary of the different types of CTOs. 
    * **Infrastructure Manager** - think of big / established companies that add in a CTO to handle the IT side of the world

    * **Technology Visionary and Operations Manager** - typical model seen these days I think where the dev/ops team reports up to the CTO
    
    * **External Facing Technologist** - kind of the nerd in the sales room / outside world. The guy that can come in and talk to the business to make the sale or be the face of the tech for the company.
    
    * **Big Thinker** - someone always focused on tech and where it is headed and how to handle that. 

    It's fun to think through which one I'd prefer to be and also which one it'd be best to report to.

    The short answer is yes, you should be a developer as a CTO but really that's just prepare you to be able to talk the lingo and understand things. If you're someone who can do that but hasn't offcially held a developer position then that's ok but I think it's those years of building products as a developer that gets you the understanding of what happens in the some times black box of software development. I don't believe the best developers make the best CTOs. It's probably actually the ok developers that make solid CTOs.
