    *Thoughts:* Solid deep dive into the Stock Options world of startups and important things to note. Really it's best to be an investor. The employee is usually giving blood, sweat, and tears for a chance at making some money that really would be significantly less than the others involved (founders, executives, investors). What the employee gains is experience and a paycheck but those options are usually not worth as much as advertised. Never sacrafice paycheck #'s for options (never say never but it would have to be a rare situation).
