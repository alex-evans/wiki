## Revenue

- Recuring Revenue!!!

- Having over 1000 customers giving over $100 to $200 a year is nearly impossible

- 150 interested Customers is doable (if you can't get to that point then it's not a doable company)

- How do you make things valid to charge higher amounts of money?

- Be respectful to people and you will find people will be willing to talk to you

- Botique
    A shop with very few people that are pricey but the work is unique and it is a special product

- Annual Prepay trick
    "If you sign up now for annual I'll give you 2 months free"
    Get that money now instead over the entire year. Getting it upfront gives you options to improve on things now.

    Coupon for "3 months free" if they signup for annual prepay (send it to bloggers or people out here to give to their listeners)

- Price the most for a "business" price line

- Instead of free trials use a 60 day money back guarentee

- Don't be afraid to change prices, do it and react

- No picking up pennies / using donations (Instead go get customers and charge them lots of money)


## Markets

- Business to Business!!!!

- There's no money in it (consumers are too price focused)

- No temporary pain (weddings / events)

- Naturally recurring

- Tied to financial cycles
