## Revenue

- Recuring Revenue!!!

- Having over 1000 customers giving over $100 to $200 a year is nearly impossible

- 150 interested Customers is doable (if you can't get to that point then it's not a doable company)

- How do you make things valid to charge higher amounts of money?

- Be respectful to people and you will find people will be willing to talk to you

- Botique
    A shop with very few people that are pricey but the work is unique and it is a special product

- Annual Prepay trick
    "If you sign up now for annual I'll give you 2 months free"
    Get that money now instead over the entire year. Getting it upfront gives you options to improve on things now.

    Coupon for "3 months free" if they signup for annual prepay (send it to bloggers or people out here to give to their listeners)

- Price the most for a "business" price line

- Instead of free trials use a 60 day money back guarentee

- Don't be afraid to change prices, do it and react

- No picking up pennies / using donations (Instead go get customers and charge them lots of money)


## Markets

- Business to Business!!!!

- There's no money in B2C (consumers are too price focused)

- No temporary pain (weddings / events)

- Naturally recurring

- Tied to financial cycles

- Avoid marketplace

- Good market = Something that can be done

- Be in a big market

-----------------

How do you get Customers

- Social media is not great (lots of time with very little payback)

- Pay per click = Monthly Revenue / 25 (there's a whole algorithm here to figure out how to get this #)

------------------

The Squeeze

- If everything works, things keep growing. If it keeps growing and you don't hire more people you'll have bad customer support. So you hire people. Which changes your job.

Answers to not deal with this change
- Sell before it's too big (tough and you usually don't get much money)
- Sell to partners
- Sell to the biggest customer
- Raise prices
- Raise money (then what was the point of bootstrapping)

This all beats not doing all of this. Remember that. But be aware of this. What do you want out of this whole process? What is fullfiling to you? Success leads to this difficult problem. Make sure you keep an eye on it and talk to others about it. It's a problem you hope for.
