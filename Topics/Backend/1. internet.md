## How does the internet work?
Picture your local network with a bunch of devices all interacting through connecting to the router which pulls in the internet from the outside. Really it's that same idea but at scale. Many machines building a mesh of connections so that there is no single pipe controlling the entire flow of information.

Everything can be broken down into binary (1s and 0s) - bits are used to send data over the internet. Electricity through wires represent the 1s and 0s, where fiber optics uses light (much more reliable). WiFi uses radio waves to transfer the bits to machines where it is translated back into the binary states. All of these are used to connect the mesh together of the internet and keep data moving.
